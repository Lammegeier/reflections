Q. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A. When working on a project with other developers, or from multiple computers/locations. I or we can edit remotely but upload to a central repository. Also helps not to lose work if any machine fails.

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A. You would want to examine the changes first before deciding if you need them, agree with them etc.
